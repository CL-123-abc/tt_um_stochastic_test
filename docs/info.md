## How it works
Stochastic Multiplier using bipolar representation. 
4-bit inputs and output of actual probability value.

## How to test
main takes two separate inputs to give 1 output, and the output is the result of multiplication after 8 bits.
test-adder takes two separate inputs to give 1 output, and the output is the result of addition after 8 bits.
test-avg takes two separate inputs to give 1 output, and the output is the result of multiplication after 128 bits.
test-self-multiply-D-FF takes 1 input to give 1 output, and the output is the result of multiplication after 128 bits.
